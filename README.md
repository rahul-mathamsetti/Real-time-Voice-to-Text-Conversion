# INTRODUCTION (Voice-to-Text)
This project focuses on developing a user-friendly application for real-time voice-to-text conversion and multilingual text-to-speech synthesis, leveraging advancements in AI and deep learning. Utilizing the WebRTC protocol for real-time communication, we employ Mozilla's deepspeech model for speech recognition, and Streamlit library for the interface. For multilingual text-to-speech synthesis, we use the Pywhisper model and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library. The methodology includes capturing audio streams, processing them with deepspeech, displaying transcriptions in real-time, and enabling users to select a target language for speech synthesis with Pywhisper and gTTS.

# Final Implementation 
* Our code has been updated to include the WebRTC protocol, which enables real-time voice-to-text conversion using the DeepSpeech model. This update allows the application to seamlessly convert spoken words to text in real-time, resulting in a more efficient and user-friendly experience.

## Step by step implementation

**Step 1:** Install Anaconda
  * Install Anaconda on your computer by downloading and running the installation file from the official Anaconda website.

**Step 2:** Clone the repository
  * Command: git clone https://github.com/AasishCh/CCN_PROJECT

**Step 3:** Create Virtual Environment and Install Packages
  * Create a new virtual environment and install all the packages and libraries described in the "requirements.txt" file.
  * Commands:
    1. conda create --name ccn_project
    2. conda activate ccn_project
    3. pip install pywhisper==1.0.6
    4. pip install streamlit==1.20.0
    5. pip install gtts==2.3.1
    6. pip install pyaudio==0.2.13
    7. pip install numpy==1.24.2
    8. pip install translate==3.6.1
    9. pip install pydub==0.25.1
    10. pip install deepspeech==0.9.3
    11. pip install wave==0.0.2

**Step 4:** Place all the files in appropriate folders
  * Activate the virtual environment by running the following command: **conda activate myenv**, This will activate the virtual environment you just created, allowing you to use the Python packages and environment settings specific to that environment. 
  * The python code and the audio file should be placed in the "ccn_project" virtual environment(Where the anaconda is installed). Make sure that streamlit_app.py and path_of_file.wav under same folder. 
  * On my laptop the path is "C:/ProgramData/Anaconda3/envs/sample_ccn".

**Step 5:**
  * Navigate to the folder where your code and required packages exist. Once in the correct directory, run the command "streamlit run streamlit_app.py" to start the application. This will launch a local server and open the application in your default web browser. 
  * Command: **streamlit run streamlit_app.py**
     
**Step 6:**
  * If any errors occur, check that all required dependencies are installed by running the following command 
  * Command: **pip install -r requirements.txt**
  * We have used SERVEO which is used to expose the local servers to the internet. It used SSH to create a secure tunnel between the users local machine and a publicly accessible server. 
  * To use Serveo to make your local Streamlit web application public and accessible to all users, follow these steps:

**Step 7:**
  * Make sure your Streamlit web application is running locally on your machine and is accessible through your web browser at http://localhost:8501.
  * Open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command, replacing example with a unique subdomain name
  * Command: **ssh -R voicetotext.serveo.net:80:localhost:8501 serveo.net**
  * Press Enter to run the command. Serveo will establish an SSH tunnel to your local machine and generate a public URL that you can use to access your Streamlit web application.
  * Copy the public URL provided by Serveo and share it with your users. They can open the URL in their web browser to access your Streamlit web application.

## System Requirements

**Memory:** A minimum of 8GB RAM is recommended for smooth operation.<br>
**Disk Space:** At least 2GB of free disk space for storing the deep learning models, libraries, and other project files.<br>
**Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.<br>
